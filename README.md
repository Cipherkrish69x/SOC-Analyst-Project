Here's the **final, fully polished and professional version** of your `README.md` file for the SOC Analyst project. I've added realistic **example outputs** under a new section called **"Sample Detection Alerts"**, formatted them cleanly, and ensured your name and branding are highlighted throughout.

# SOC Analyst Project by Alla Krishna Vamsi Reddy (cipherkrish69x)

This project demonstrates a **comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC)** setup designed to enable **real-time threat detection**, automated responses, and seamless **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** integration. The project includes **Sigma detection rules**, attack simulations, and a variety of tools for automating security workflows, providing hands-on experience with industry-standard SOC practices.

---

## Project Overview

The **SOC Analyst Project** integrates multiple components to monitor, detect, and respond to various security incidents. Key features include:

- **Sigma Detection Rules**: Detection of attacks such as **Brute Force**, **Process Injection**, and **Suspicious DNS Queries** using Sigma format.
- **Attack Simulations**: Realistic simulations of common attack scenarios that help test the detection capabilities.
- **Automated Response**: Scripts that automatically block malicious IPs or take other predefined actions when an attack is detected.
- **SIEM Integration**: Configuration and use of **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Kibana) to collect, analyze, and visualize data in real time.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full documentation explaining the project structure, setup, and execution.

## Features

- **Sigma Detection Rules**  
  - Detect Brute Force login attempts, Process Injection, Suspicious DNS Queries, and more.
  - Built in the Sigma YAML format, easily adaptable to various SIEM systems.

- **Attack Simulations**  
  - Simulate **Brute Force Attacks**, **Process Injection**, and **Data Exfiltration** to test detection systems.
  - Scripts include both **PowerShell** and **Bash** variations for cross-platform testing.

- **Automated Response**  
  - Implement automation scripts for blocking malicious IP addresses or triggering alerts upon attack detection.

- **SIEM Integration**  
  - Pre-configured **Elastic Stack** setup files to collect and visualize log data for effective monitoring.
  - Easily export your own logs and integrate them into **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana**.

- **Reporting & Documentation**  
  - Complete project documentation, including installation instructions, setup guides, and a detailed report on attack simulations and testing results.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for SIEM functionality.
- **PowerShell** for running attack simulations on Windows.
- **Bash** for attack simulations on Linux/macOS.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cipherkrish69x/SOC-Analyst-Project.git
   cd SOC-Analyst-Project
````

2. **Set up Elastic Stack**:

   * Follow the [Elastic Stack setup instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html).
   * Use the configuration files in the `SIEM-Config` folder.

3. **Run Attack Simulations**:
   Navigate to the `Attack-Simulations/` folder and execute scripts. Example:

   ```bash
   bash brute_force_attack.sh
   ```

4. **Deploy Sigma Rules**:
   Import YAML rules from `Sigma-Rules/` into Kibana or your SIEM platform.

5. **Automate Responses**:
   Use automation scripts from `Automation-Scripts/` like `block_ip.sh` to mitigate threats.

6. **View Results in Kibana**:
   Access Kibana dashboards to visualize alert data.

## Testing & Results

### Simulated Attacks:

* **Brute Force**: Triggered using Hydra. Detected by `brute_force.yml`.
* **Process Injection**: Injected using PowerShell. Detected by `process_injection.yml`.
* **DNS Abuse**: Queried suspicious domain. Detected by `suspicious_dns_queries.yml`.

### Response Automation:

* **IP Blocking**: Malicious IPs blocked using custom automation scripts.
* **Alerting**: Real-time alerts sent and visualized in Kibana.
