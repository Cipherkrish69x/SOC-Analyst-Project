# SOC Analyst Project Report

## Introduction

This project aims to create a realistic and comprehensive SOC Analyst environment to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. Using the **Sigma rule format**, attack simulations, and SIEM integration, the project demonstrates how SOC analysts can effectively monitor for security incidents and automate responses to mitigate them.

## Objectives

1. **Develop detection rules**: Create Sigma rules to identify common attack techniques like Brute Force, Process Injection, and Suspicious DNS Queries.
2. **Simulate attacks**: Use scripts to simulate various attacks that SOC analysts might encounter in a real-world scenario.
3. **Automate responses**: Create scripts that automatically block malicious IPs or take other actions to prevent damage.
4. **Configure SIEM**: Set up a SIEM solution using the Elastic Stack to visualize and analyze logs.

## Results

- **Detection Rules**: The Sigma rules were successful in detecting various attack techniques.
- **Attack Simulations**: The simulated attacks (e.g., Brute Force, Process Injection) were successfully detected by the Sigma rules.
- **Automated Response**: The IP blocking automation script effectively blocked malicious IPs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the key elements of SOC operations and provides a hands-on environment for learning and practicing threat detection, incident response, and SIEM configuration. The project can serve as a template for building real-world SOC environments.
